# Question

> "According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, if a piece of chalk were to be completely converted to energy, how many days of power would that piece of chalk provide to Vancouver?"

> - Pair or triple up.
> - Feel free to check online for whatever data you need to assume.
> - Don't Google the question.
> - When you've got an answer, write it on the whiteboard, expressed in "number of days".
> - Spend 5 minutes on this max.

# Lesson

> Order of magnitude is more than accurate enough.

- Think in scales, thinking at scale.
- Approximations that answer the right question are better than precisely answering the wrong question.

---

# A lesson in approximation with computation

> - How much exactly does flu shuffle its genome in the world? Is it important for switching viral hosts?
> - Answered in Ma et. al., 2016 (PNAS).

---

# How would you solve these problems?

> I just flipped that starfish over... How long do starfishes take to flip back over?

> Are there outlier Pokemons? Do their height/weight combinations actually make sense?

- Pair or triple up.
- Take 5 minutes to outline a strategy for answering one of these questions. Specifically asnwer the question: what are you going to measure?
- Share at the end.

# Science as measurement

- T1 Bamfield: Starfish flipping.
- T2 Measurement: Antimicrobial properties of traditional Chinese herb extracts.

---

# Science as Measurement

- Taking an engineering approach to measurement in the life sciences.
    - Systematically measuring how mutations affect phenotype.
    - Deep learning algorithms to learn mapping from
    - Modelling error in measurement and propagating through phenotype predictions.
- Thinking at Scale: How much viral drug resistance is out there?

---

# Conclusion

- Think in scales, and think at scale.
- Learn how to measure with precision, and quantify your uncertainty.
- Have fun, it'll be great, you'll all do fine.
